# bosch_locator_bridge

## Overview

This package provides a [ROS 1] interface to the [Rexroth ROKIT Locator].
It translates ROS 1 messages to the ROKIT Locator API (as described in the ROKIT Locator API documentation) and vice versa.
It also allows to control the ROKIT Locator via ROS 1 service calls.

The package has been tested under [ROS 1] Noetic and Ubuntu 20.04.
The bridge is compatible with ROKIT Locator version 1.7.
If you have an earlier version, see [Support of earlier versions of ROKIT Locator](#support-of-earlier-versions-of-rokit-locator).

## Quick Start

This section describes how to record your environment, create a map out of the record and localize yourself within it.

#### Ensure the ROKIT Locator is reachable from your computer

Make sure the ROKIT Locator is installed and running on a computer in your network. You can test this by running the following command in a terminal (replace `<LOCATOR_IP>` by the IP address of the computer running the ROKIT Locator):
```sh
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"aboutModulesList","params":{"query":{}},"id":1}' http://<LOCATOR_IP>:8080
```

#### Start Bridge Node

Start the bridge node with

    roslaunch bosch_locator_bridge bridge.launch bridge_ip:=<HOST_IP> locator_ip:=<LOCATOR_IP> locator_user:=<USER> locator_password:=<PASSWORD> scan_topic:=<SCAN_TOPIC> enable_odometry:=<ENABLE_ODOM> odom_topic:=<ODOM_TOPIC>

where
- `<HOST_IP>` is the IP address of the computer the bridge is to be started
- `<LOCATOR_IP>` is the IP address of the computer where the ROKIT Locator is running
- `<USER>` and `<PASSWORD>` are the credentials to log into the ROKIT Locator
- `<SCAN_TOPIC>` is the topic name of the laser scans
- `<ENABLE_ODOM>` is a boolean that describes whether you want to forward odometry ROS messages to the ROKIT Locator
- `<ODOM_TOPIC>` is the topic name of the odometry

Since the Laser Localization Software is running in docker, the `<HOST_IP>` has to be set to docker0 ip address (172.17.0.1) instead of localhost ip address (127.0.0.1) when the user program providing the laser data runs on the same machine.

For additional parameters please refer to the launch file [bridge.launch](./launch/bridge.launch).

#### Start Visual Recording

Then, make sure there are laser scans published on `<SCAN_TOPIC>`, and start the visual recording with e.g.

    rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find bosch_locator_bridge`/config/locator_bridge_visual_recording.rviz
    rosservice call /bridge_node/start_visual_recording "name: 'ROS-Quickstart-$(date -Isecond)'"

You should see the laser scans, the robot position and its previous path, and the recording  built up over time.

#### Stop Visual Recording

When you are done, you can stop recording with

    rosservice call /bridge_node/stop_visual_recording

#### Create Map From Recording

Now, create a map from your recording with

    rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find bosch_locator_bridge`/config/locator_bridge_map_creation.rviz
    rosservice call /bridge_node/start_map "" ""

When the map has been created, it must be sent to the map server and set as the active map.

    rosservice call /bridge_node/send_map ""
    rosservice call /bridge_node/set_map ""

#### Start Localization

Finally, you can start the localization with

    rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find bosch_locator_bridge`/config/locator_bridge_localization.rviz
    rosservice call /bridge_node/start_localization

You can set the initial pose of the robot by clicking the "2D Pose Estimate" button in RViz, and then set the pose in the map.

#### Stop Localization

When you are done, you can stop the localization with

    rosservice call /bridge_node/stop_localization

## Nodes

### bridge_node

This node provides an interface to the localization client.

#### ROKIT Locator Configuration

The bridge looks for ROS parameters under **`/bridge_node/localization_client_config`** and sets these to the ROKIT Locator configuration. This is done only once, during the start of the `bridge_node`.
See the ROKIT Locator API documentation section 8.5.4 for a list of possible options.

To correctly forward the laser scan data, it is important that `ClientSensor.laser.type` is set to `simple`, and that `ClientSensor.laser.address` is set to the IP address (with port) of the computer the bridge is running.

## Caveats

### ROKIT Locator closes connection

The ROKIT Locator performs a strict input validation checks and closes the connection, if it receives data that is outside of its specified range.
If you see error messages of this kind in the output of the ROS bridge:
```
Connection reset by peer
```
Double check the data sent and compare it with the acceptable values in the ROKIT Locator API documentation.

Also peek in the LocalizationClient's syslog file (see the ROKIT Locator documentation) for hints (usually `validation of ... failed`).

### Error message: SENSOR_NOT_AVAILABLE

This can happen if you switch the ROKIT Locator into a mode where it requires e.g. laser data, but none is available (e.g. no laser data is sent with a few hundred miliseconds after the mode switch).

To avoid this, make sure `LaserScan` messages are sent to the bridge before switching the ROKIT Locator mode.
