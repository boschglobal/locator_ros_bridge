# locator_ros_bridge

This repository contains the [bosch_locator_bridge](bosch_locator_bridge) package, which provides a [ROS] interface to the [Rexroth ROKIT Locator].
It translates ROS messages to the ROKIT Locator API (as described in the ROKIT Locator API documentation) and vice versa.
It also allows to control the ROKIT Locator via ROS service calls.

There are versions for the following ROS 1 and ROS 2 distributions:
* ROS 1: Noetic (branch [noetic](../../tree/noetic), will likely also work on Melodic)
* ROS 2: Foxy (this branch), Rolling (branch [main](../../tree/main), will likely also work on Galactic)

The following video (click on image) gives more information about the Rexroth ROKIT Locator.
